    types of accounts for different levels of service or different types of Users. User may not use the account of another user
    without permission from Glidepath and the applicable user.<br> User will keep its Account Interface user name and password
    confidential and will be responsible for all activities conducted and fees incurred through the use of User’s user name and
    password. User must immediately notify Glidepath of any unauthorized uses User’s account or any other breaches of

    the Services to the Employer’s website (a “Widget.”) Glidepath may also provide the option for a hosted sub-domain on
    Glidepath’s URL or a sub-domain at Employer’s URL, with varying degrees of customization as permitted by the user interface
    of the Services.<br> Add-on Services. The Services may include or be integrated with one or more add-on services provided
    by third party vendors and governed by separate terms and conditions furnished by such vendors. User must review such terms
    and conditions before purchasing or otherwise accessing any such add-on services. Glidepath may discontinue add-on services
    or change vendors at any time for any reason, with no liability to User other than credit or refund for discontinued
    pre-paid services, if any. User acknowledges that any services or credits purchased via Glidepath will expire one (1) year
    from the date of purchase of said credit or service, unless otherwise specified.<br> Restrictions<br> Technology

    including without limitation, “robots,” “spiders,” or “offline readers,” that accesses

    names, voices or likenesses contained therein), in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known
    or hereafter developed, for use in connection with the Services and Glidepath’s business.<br> Without limitation to the

    attorneys’ fees) incurred by Glidepath in collecting any amounts due and unpaid by the User hereunder. The User shall
    be solely responsible for payment of all applicable taxes (other than those on Glidepath’s net income).<br> Free Accounts.

    accounts. User may terminate its use of a free account at any time without notice. Notwithstanding Section 8, Services
    associated with a free account are provided “AS IS,” and Glidepath expressly disclaims all warranties and
    conditions, express, implied or statutory.<br> Term and Termination<br> Term. The term of the Agreement shall begin upon
    User’s first submission of required Information and shall continue for the duration of User’s selected subscription.
    Subscriptions will automatically renew unless either party provides the other party of its intention not to renew prior to
    the expiration of the then-current subscription term.<br> Termination. Either party may terminate this agreement if the
    other party commits a material breach and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after written notice is given to
    the breaching party, specifying the breach. User may terminate its participation in the Services at any time for any reason
    or for no reason, via the Account Interface if such functionality is available or, if not available, by written notice to
    Glidepath as provided herein. Such termination will be effective, and Glidepath will cease providing the Services to User,
    no later than two (2) business days after Glidepath’s receipt of such notice.<br> Suspension. Glidepath may permanently or
    temporarily terminate or suspend access to the Service to User or to Glidepath’s users generally, without notice and
    liability for any reason or for no reason.<br> Effect of Termination. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement for
    any reason: (a) all rights and subscriptions granted to User under this Agreement will terminate; (b) User will immediately
    cease all use of and access to the Services; (c) all fees then owed by User will become immediately due and payable; and (d)
    except in the case of termination by User for Glidepath’s breach or termination by Glidepath for reasons other than User’s
    breach, User will not be entitled to any refund of fees paid or pre-paid. Termination of this Agreement shall not affect the
    obligations of the parties under Sections 2, 3, 4(a), 8(c), and 9 through 11 of this Agreement, which shall survive the
    termination of this Agreement.<br> DMCA<br> It is Glidepath’s policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright

    591-4545<br> Email: support@glidepath.com<br> Warranty &amp; disclaimer<br> User warranties. User hereby represents and
    warrants that: (a) User has the full right, power, and authority to grant the rights and consents granted herein; (b) User
    will comply with all applicable laws and regulations in its use of the Services and in its business operations, including
    without limitation laws regarding data privacy, employment and employment discrimination; and (c) User will comply with
    Glidepath policies applicable to the Services, as posted on the Website (collectively “Policies”).<br> Glidepath Warranty.
    Glidepath represents and warrants that the Services will operate in substantial conformity with their applicable
    specifications. User’s exclusive remedy for breach of this warranty is to notify Glidepath of the nonconformity in
    writing, whereupon GlidePath, as its sole obligation and liability, will at its election, either: (i) use commercially
    reasonable efforts to correct the nonconformity within thirty (30) days; or (ii) terminate this Agreement and refund to User
    a pro rata portion of the fees actually paid for the non-conforming Services, based on the date of User’s notification. This
    Section 8(b) sets forth Glidepath’s entire liability to User for any nonconformity or other defect in the
    Services.<br> Disclaimer. Except as expressly set forth herein, and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the
    Services are provided “AS IS,” and Glidepath expressly disclaims all warranties and conditions, whether express,
    implied or statutory, including but not limited to all implied or statutory warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
    particular purpose, title, quality, accuracy and noninfringement of third party rights. Without limitation to the foregoing,
    Glidepath disclaims all warranties regarding: (i) the behavior of other Users; (ii) Content posted on the Website by third
    parties, including other users; (iii) responses or response rates to job posts or job applications; (iv) the appearance or
    quality of any Content on any particular software (including browsers), system configuration, monitor resolution or other
    user equipment; (v) Affiliate sites or other third party sites to which the Website may link, including without limitation,
    their availability, operations, features, functionality and content; (vi) the accuracy of data supplied by Affiliates
    regarding Affiliate sites; and (vii) the Services’ compliance with regulatory requirements that may apply to particular
    Employers, such as the tracking and record-keeping requirements of the OFCCP.<br> Indemnity<br> By Glidepath. Glidepath
    will indemnify, defend and hold User harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities and expenses (including
    reasonable attorneys’ fees) suffered or incurred by reason of any third-party claims, proceedings or suits based on or
    arising out of the Technology’s infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights.<br> By User. The User will
    indemnify, defend and hold Glidepath, its Affiliates and their respective representatives harmless from and against any and
    all losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) suffered or incurred by reason of any
    third-party claims, proceedings or suits based on or arising out of (i) any breach or alleged breach by User of its
    representations, warranties or covenants hereunder; or (ii) the User’s Content; (iii) the User’s websites and in each case
    the products and services promoted therein; and (iv) subject to Glidepath’s obligations under Section 9(a), User’s access to
    or use of the Services.<br> Procedures. The obligations set forth in Section 9 are conditioned upon the indemnified party
    notifying the indemnifying party promptly in writing of any covered action, giving the indemnifying party sole control over
    the defense thereof and any related settlement negotiations, and cooperating and, at the indemnifying party’s request
    and expense, assisting in such defense. The indemnified party may also participate in the defense at its own expense.<br>
    Limitation of Liability. In no event will Glidepath, its representatives, successors or assigns, be liable for any punitive,
    exemplary, incidental or consequential damages in any action arising from or related to this Agreement or the Services,
    whether based in contract, tort (including negligence), intended conduct or otherwise, including without limitation, damages
    relating to the loss of profits, income or goodwill, regardless of whether such party has been advised of the possibility of
    such damages. In no event will Glidepath’s liability for monetary damages related to this Agreement exceed the amount paid
    by the User to Glidepath over the three-month period immediately preceding the action. The foregoing provisions shall be
    enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.<br> Miscellaneous. This Agreement shall be construed in
    accordance with and governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Delaware and not by the laws of any other
    jurisdiction. The parties mutually consent and submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts for New Castle
    County, Delaware, and agree that any action, suit or proceeding concerning this Agreement may be brought in the federal or
    state courts of such county and that they will not raise, in connection therewith, any defense or objection based on lack of
    personal jurisdiction, improper venue, inconvenience of forum or the like. Glidepath may unilaterally modify this Agreement
    or any of its Policies at any time without liability, and User’s continued use of the Services after notice of such
    modification constitutes User’s acceptance of such modification. Any modifications to this Agreement by User must be made in
    a writing executed by both parties. Failure of Glidepath to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement shall not be
    construed as a general relinquishment or waiver as to that or any other provision. If any provision of this Agreement is
    held invalid, it shall be modified to reflect the parties’ intention and only to the extent necessary to make it
    enforceable, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. User’s relationship with Glidepath
    will be that of an independent contractor and nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to constitute either party as the
    other’s partner, joint venturer, representative, agent or employee for any purpose. The User may not resell, assign or
    transfer any of its rights hereunder without Glidepath’s prior written consent, and any such attempt is void. All notices or
    approvals under this Agreement shall be directed to Glidepath at: 419 Park Avenue South, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10016, and
    to User at the billing address, email or other contact information provided in the Account Interface or order, or as may be
    revised in writing from time to time. Notices sent by email will be deemed received when sent. This Agreement, together with
    any appendices attached hereto and the information submitted by User in the Account Interface or order, is the entire
    agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior oral or written agreements.
    Any conflicting or additional terms contained in any other documents (e.g. purchase orders, confirmations, etc.) or oral
    discussions are void.</p>
