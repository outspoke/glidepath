          Does Glidepath require a long-term agreement or can I pay month to month? Any pricing advantages to a longer term commitment?
        </a>
        <div class="answer collapse" id="faq-sub-1">
          Glidepath offers flexible, month-to-month pricing and requires no long-term commitment. As needs change, plans can be adjusted on a monthly basis.
          Discounts are offered for annual commitments. If you are interested, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@glidepath.com">support@glidepath.com</a>
          or call <a href="tel:888-280-7434">888-280-7434</a>.

        <a class="question" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq-sub-2">
          Can I make adjustments to my subscription plan mid-month?
        </a>
        <div class="answer collapse" id="faq-sub-2">
          Subscription plans can be increased to the next tier at any time, but once a monthly billing cycle has started and your credit card has been invoiced, you can’t decrease to a lower tier until the following month.

      <div class="faq">
        <a class="question" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq-sub-3">
          If the number of jobs I have doesn’t fit into one of the fixed tiers, can I purchase only what I need (i.e. 12 slots) or can I only purchase jobs in one of the established tiers (3 slots or 10 slots)?
        </a>
        <div class="answer collapse" id="faq-sub-3">
          While we don’t support fully customized slot tiers, we can break them down in increments of 5. The established tiers are (3, 5,10,15,20,25,30, 50, and 100).

          Only Credit card payments are currently accepted for all established subscription tiers.

    <h2>Amplify</h2>
    <div class="faqs" id="faq-amplify">
      <div class="faq">
        <a class="question" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq-amplify-1">
          What is AMPLIFY and how does it work?
        </a>
        <div class="answer collapse" id="faq-amplify-1">
          AMPLIFY is a “one off” enhanced job promotion service that helps to significantly elevate the visibility of a job for 30 days. For only $100, AMPLIFYing a job will increase its exposure across the Glidepath Network and ensure that it is promoted in job seeker alerts sent to the inboxes of relevant candidates across the network. When posting a job, you’ll be asked if you want to AMPLIFY it. Simply click yes and follow the instructions. Or, if you’d like to AMPLIFY a previously posted job, go to the jobs page and click on the title of the job you want to AMPLIFY. Once there, click on the AMPLIFY button and follow the instructions.

      <div class="faq">
        <a class="question" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq-amplify-2">
          If I sign up for a subscription service plan, does that automatically AMPLIFY my jobs or do I still need to AMPLIFY urgent or high priority jobs?
        </a>
        <div class="answer collapse" id="faq-amplify-2">
          While a subscription Service Plan will allow you to publish and distribute the number of jobs that fall within the tier you have selected, AMPLIFYing your jobs provides a significant lift in sponsorship placement along with inclusion in jobseeker alerts, providing on average, a 3X impact on apply volume. Glidepath’s most successful clients have a subscription agreement to cover ALL their jobs and then selectively Amplify those jobs that have extra urgency or those that are more high priority.

        <a class="question" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq-amplify-3">
          If I have a subscription service plan and AMPLIFY a job, does that use up one of my tier job slots?
        </a>
        <div class="answer collapse" id="faq-amplify-3">
          No, Amplified jobs are “in addition to” the number of job slots you have available, depending on your subscription tier. For example, if you have a ten (10) job slot subscription tier and you decide to Amplify one of your jobs, you will “free up” a posting slot in which you can add another job.

        <a class="question" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq-amplify-4">
          Do I need to refresh my Amplified jobs or are they automatically refreshed?
        </a>
        <div class="answer collapse" id="faq-amplify-4">
          While a weekly refresh option is available for premium jobs, Amplified jobs include auto-refresh and do NOT require doing so manually.

        <a class="question" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq-misc-1">
          What are “promoted jobs”?
        </a>
        <div class="answer collapse" id="faq-misc-1">
          Promoted jobs are job postings that are active and set for distribution to our premium job board partners at any given time. For example, If you subscribe to three (3) promoted jobs, then you can post three jobs for premium distribution. Additional jobs posted beyond your purchased number of job slots can be ‘Posted’ to your Job Opportunities page, but will not be distributed out to the Glidepath Network.

        <a class="question" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq-misc-2">
          Can I pick the sites on which my job will appear?
        </a>
        <div class="answer collapse" id="faq-misc-2">
          No, Glidepath automatically distributes your promoted jobs to our entire network of job board partners. It is not necessary to pick and choose the boards you’d like your job to appear on. All you do is click ‘Publish’ and we’ll do the rest!

          What if I have a position I am always recruiting for?
        </a>
        <div class="answer collapse" id="faq-misc-3">
          If you consistently recruit for the same position, you may leave your job posted and open for an unlimited period of time. It is recommended, however, that you periodically “refresh” your job posting date by clicking the “set to today” link on the job overview page. This keeps your job from growing stale and ensures consistent applicant flow. Jobs can be refreshed up to one time per week.

          Is Glidepath planning to add any additional job boards?

        <div class="answer collapse" id="faq-misc-4">
          Glidepath is always on the lookout for new job board partners and continues to add to its network. If you have a favorite job board you would like us to include, please let us know.

          Can Glidepath help recruit international applicants?
        </a>
        <div class="answer collapse" id="faq-misc-5">
          At this time, Glidepath supports and focuses on the recruiting of applicants within the United States. Should we expand internationally, we will let you know.

          How long does it take to start seeing activity on my job posting?
        </a>
        <div class="answer collapse" id="faq-misc-6">
          New job posts typically take 12-24 hours to reach all boards within the Glidepath network and another day for the relay of job seeker email alerts. A good rule of thumb is to expect to start seeing applicants a day after posting and to expect your best response flow starting about 48 hours after posting.

          Can I post a job nationwide?
        </a>
        <div class="answer collapse" id="faq-misc-7">
          All job posts on Glidepath require a city, state and zip code specific to the job’s location. This increases job visibility in the geographic region of the job, however all job posts are searchable nationwide.

        <div class="answer collapse" id="faq-misc-8">
          Jobs remain posted and visible as long as they remain published to the Glidepath network. It is recommended, however, that you periodically refresh your job to maintain its effectiveness. To do so, simply click the “Set to today” link on the job overview page.

        <div class="answer collapse" id="faq-misc-9">
          Glidepath will send you an email notification each time an applicant applies for a posted job. This notification contains a brief applicant summary along with a link to the full applicant profile within Glidepath. If your account has multiple users, you may select who you wish to receive these email notification when you create your job.
