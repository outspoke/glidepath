    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Glidepath collects information that allows us to provide you with a full range of customized services. The information that we collect from our users includes the following:</p>
    <h3 class="alt-header">INFORMATION THAT YOU SUBMIT</h3>
    <p>
      Glidepath collects and retains any information that you submit to our website or provide to us in any other way, including information regarding your employment search (if you are a candidate) or your candidate search (if you are an employer).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Registration. In order to use certain Glidepath services, you must first complete a registration form that requires certain personal information including your name, business name (if applicable), and relevant contact information. You will also be required to create a user name and password for access to your account.
      </li>
      <li>
        Settings and Preferences. Upon registration or any time you use your account, you will have the ability to adjust the profile, preferences and settings associated with your account. These settings may include, for example, the choice to receive email alerts or other communications from Glidepath and the choice to store information in your account, such as records of searches, communications or other account activity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Orders. If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as payment card number and expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. Glidepath will process payment card information according to rules of the applicable payment processor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Applications. If you are a candidate and submit a resume, CV or other job application information to Glidepath, we will store such information within your account and our candidate database. GlidePath will share such information with employers to which you apply, as well as other employers that search Glidepath’s candidate database.
      </li>
      <li>
        Questionnaires. Certain employers may request responses from candidates to customized surveys or questionnaires. If you provide such responses, Glidepath will share them with the applicable employer. If you choose not to provide such responses, an employer may not accept your job application.
      </li>
      <li>
        Communications. We will send you a welcoming email to verify your user name and password. You may choose to receive newsletters or email alerts from Glidepath about new features and services, special deals or promotions, or (if you are a candidate) alerts about new jobs that match your preferences, application history, location or other information associated with your account. In the future, we may also offer the choice to receive such information by mobile messaging.
      </li>
      <li>
        Other Correspondence. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries (including customer support inquiries), to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. In such correspondence, you may choose to provide your email address, name, comments or other personal information.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition to the particular uses of information described above, Glidepath uses your submitted information as described below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Glidepath uses submitted information to provide you with our products and services, including the employment search and candidate search and management. We also use such information for auditing, research and analysis; maintaining, protecting and improving our services; developing new services; and ensuring the proper functioning of our systems and infrastructure.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Services may combine the information you submit under your Glidepath account with information from third parties (including employers) in order to provide users with a better experience and to enhance our services. For example, employers may submit to their Glidepath accounts application or other information from third party sources. Glidepath may also enable employers to obtain such third-party information through the service user interface, for example, by requesting a background check on applicants from a Glidepath business partner, subject to any required consents.
      </li>
      <li>
        Glidepath processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America. In some cases, that may mean that we process personal information on a server outside your own country.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="alt-header">INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT AUTOMATICALLY</h3>
    <p>
      Glidepath and its authorized agents automatically collect and retain certain types of information whenever you interact with Glidepath’s website and services.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Log files. As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically through users’ user of the Website, and we store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to maintain your User Profile (as described below) and to analyze trends, to track users’ movements around the site, to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and to administer and improve the Website and our services.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cookies. Cookies are small text files stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. Glidepath uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies to enable our systems to maintain your login status, recognize your browser, store your password (if desired), and record how and when our website and services are utilized. Most Web browsers allow users to receive notification when new cookies are set, specify which cookies to accept and reject, or disable cookies entirely (consult your browser’s “Help” menu for guidance on adjusting your settings). We recommend that you accept all cookies from Glidepath because turning them off may prevent or impair your access to our website and services.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clear Gifs. We may also employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
      </li>
      <li>
        User Profile. We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, to create a “User Profile” of your preferences. We tie this information to the information in the profile and account in order to provide more relevant content and services to you.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information sharing and disclosure</h2>
    <h3 class="alt-header">AGGREGATE DATA</h3>
    <p>
      Glidepath may share certain aggregated, non-personal information with third parties for marketing, reporting and other purposes, such as the aggregated number of visitors to our website, the search terms that those visitors used, or the number of times users visited a certain part of the site, used certain features of the site, or clicked particular content, advertisements or links. Such aggregated, non-personal information does not identify you individually.
    </p>
    <h3 class="alt-header">INFORMATION YOU POST</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When candidates submit resumes, CVs and related job application information to the Website, such information is searchable and viewable by visitors to the Website and the websites of Glidepath’s Affiliates.
      </li>
      <li>
        Job postings submitted by employers (including any relevant company information or contact information in or related to the posting) are searchable and viewable by visitors to the Website and the websites of current or future third parties participating in GlidePath’s advertising affiliate network (each an “Affiliate.”)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="alt-header">LIMITED DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Glidepath’s employees, consultants, and contractors may have access to your personal information if necessary in the normal course of our business operations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Glidepath may provide your personal information to third parties that we have contracted with to help us deliver services or process data (such as delivering email, conducting a survey or questionnaire, or processing transactions). In these cases, we disclose information only to the extent we deem necessary to achieve the purpose at hand and use service providers that have provided assurances about the security and confidentiality of the data that we share.
      </li>
      <li>
        If Glidepath, or any portion of its assets, is acquired by a third party, the information we have collected and stored may be among the assets transferred to the acquiring party.
      </li>
      <li>
        We may release personal information if we believe that doing so is necessary to comply with a law, court order or subpoena; enforce or apply our Terms of Use or other policies; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Glidepath, our employees, our users, or others.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third Party Advertisers</h2>
    <p>
      Any ads that may appear on this website or Glidepath-branded emails are delivered to users by third-party advertising partners, who may use cookies and clear gifs on this website or in emails, to allow it to recognize users. We may share website usage information about users with such advertisers for the purpose of targeting our advertisements to users. Glidepath encourages its advertisers to provide more information about such practices and the choices available to you, either on the applicable website or in applicable emails.
    </p>

    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>
      This website contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Glidepath. Please be aware that we, Glidepath, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.
    </p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
      You must be at least 13 years of age to register to use the Glidepath website. Glidepath is not intended for children under 13 years of age. Glidepath does not knowingly collect personal information about children under the age of 13. If we learn that GlidePath has received information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. We recommend that minors between the ages of 13 and 17 ask and receive their parents’ permission before using Glidepath or sending information about themselves or anyone else over the Internet.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      Glidepath has implemented procedural and technological measures intended to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. However, Glidepath cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will not be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information improperly. You are responsible for the security of your Glidepath username and password. We strongly recommend that you never share your Glidepath login information with others and that you protect yourself against unauthorized access to your account by logging off once you have finished using any computer that is accessible to others. For your convenience, Glidepath allows you to manage your email alert settings and preferences (such as search keywords and location) via links included in emails that we send to your inbox, and do not require a username or password to view alert information or change settings. If you share a GlidePath email alert, the recipient will be able to access your alert settings and preferences.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Control Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can choose not to disclose information to Glidepath, although doing so may limit your ability to use our website and services.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can modify your preferences regarding communications from Glidepath, either by adjusting the settings in your account or by following the instructions contained in any unwanted communications. However, please note that you may still receive administrative communications (such as welcome emails upon registration and responses to forgotten password requests) and legal notices from us as long as you remain a registered user of our website. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option of deactivating your account.
      </li>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Protect Yourself from Scams</h2>
    <p>
      Glidepath uses automated processes to collect and present information that has been created by third parties, so we cannot assure the accuracy or legitimacy of that information. We strongly recommend that you exercise caution when providing information about yourself to others online, including when you seek or contact candidates or employers through Glidepath. To protect yourself, we suggest the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Never provide social security number, credit card information, bank account details, or unnecessary personal or financial information to a potential employer or a candidate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Never participate in a financial transaction of any sort with another user of the Website.
      </li>
      <li>
        Always be cautious of opportunities that sound too good to be true or require you to act as a financial intermediary, particularly for an overseas person.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Glidepath may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, at its sole discretion. Use of information we collect from time to time is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes to our Privacy Policy, we will provide notification by posting an announcement on the Glidepath website so you can monitor the types of information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances if any, it is disclosed. It is your responsibility to review our current Privacy Policy to ensure your continued agreement with its terms. If at any point you disagree with any of the terms of our Privacy Policy, you should request deletion of your Glidepath account by contacting us.
